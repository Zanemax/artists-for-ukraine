This piece is a reference to Western allies and their dependencies on Russian gas. That is, there is little reverence given to the lives of Ukrainians who defend their sovereignty to that of the invading Russian army. The indifference towards Ukrainian civilian lives compared to Western’s dependency on Russian gas is the question raised; purchasing Russian gas fuels the Russian army to kill Ukrainians. Kadan created this piece whilst sheltering in the basement of the Voloshyn Gallery basement in Kyiv whilst the column of Russian tankswas north of Kyiv.
