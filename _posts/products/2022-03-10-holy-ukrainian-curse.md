This is a Self-Portrait of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taras_Shevchenko">Taras Shevchenko</a> (1814), before he was freed from Serfdom (Slavery) in 1838 while he was a student at the Academy of St Petersburg Academy of Art. He is considered to be the founder of modern Ukrainian literature and is the Ukrainian icon of independence. This piece is a reference to entering a Holy war against Russia of which Shevchenko, through his prose, did. In his poetry, he uses cursive language against Russian culture and imperialism. It is paired with his piece, _Russian Warship, Go Fuck Yourself_.
