Tistol’s Food series depicts various typical Soviet meals. He references the iconic Stalinist <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-book-of-tasty-and-healthy-food/">_The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food (Kniga)_</a> by mimicking the incipit colour reproductions. He plays with Soviet propaganda uniting it with Ukrainian pop-art, challenging the viewer to be interested in the formal aesthetic values of painting over that of media dissemination.
