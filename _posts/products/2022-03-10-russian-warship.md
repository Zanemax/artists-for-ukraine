It is written in Russian (not Ukrainian – to ensure Russian’s understand) ‘Russian Warship – Go Fuck Yourself.’ Gusev reappropriates the painting _Ninth Wave_, 1850 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Aivazovsky">Ivan Aivazovsky</a> (note this link still refers to Aivazovsky as Russian, rather than Armenian Ukrainian). It is a depiction of a stormy sea with shipwrecked survivors clinging for their lives. The metaphor of the Christian cross of the debris of the make-shift raft is areference to the salvation from earthly sin. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_cruiser_Moskva">Moskva</a> guided missile cruiser was Russia’s flagship of navy power and it was believed to be indestructible (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_Moskva">it sank</a>). On 25 th February 2022, the Russian navy demanded thirteen Ukrainian border guards, who were stationed on Snake Island, to surrender. They <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/ukraine-soldiers-told-russians-to-go-fuck-yourself-before-black-sea-island-death">responded</a> to the Russian officer, ‘go fuck yourself.’
