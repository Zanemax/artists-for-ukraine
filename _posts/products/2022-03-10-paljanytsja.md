This piece is from the children’s story from the Soviet times called Masha and the Wolf (Little Red Riding Hood). In early March, it was reported that Russian spies were infiltrating Ukrainian villages and cities. It test whether captives were Russian, the ‘<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/tcmfvt/captured_saboteur_is_given_the_паляниця_test/">Palyantystya</a>’ test was applied and most Russian native speakers cannot pronounce Palyantystya without a Russian accent.
