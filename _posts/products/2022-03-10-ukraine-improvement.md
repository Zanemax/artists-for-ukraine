2014, Colour Print, 50x70cm

This piece was constructed from a commonly used material in Ukrainian building construction of factories and homes. The durability of a wall reflects the instability of the security of the sense of home, and nationhood. On one side of the brick wall, it is charred, burnt and on the other side Soviet wallpaper still adheres to the bricks – a double-sided inuendo. <a href="https://www.kadyrova.com/untitled-en">The shape</a> of the installation references Crimea – the peninsula which has been annexed by the Russians in 2014.
