Since the onslaught of the war, her works focus on the <a href="https://birdinflight.com/en/inspiration/mifologiya-vijni-na-kartinah-katerini-lisovenko.html">victims and the heroes</a> of the war. Her works depict terror, death and defiance. This piece references the monumental statue in Kyiv <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherland_Monument">_Motherland Monument_</a>. However, instead of the woman holding a sword or shield, the mother states her vulnerability – bare breasted with infant in her warms standing bold and staring straight into the eyes of the Russian to ‘Go Fuck Yourself.’
