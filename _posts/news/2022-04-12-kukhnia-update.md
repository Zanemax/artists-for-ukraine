# Update from Kukhnia

Kukhnia have been working long days since the beginning of the war and they have provided us with some images of their activities.

## Notes from Olha in Lviv:

"We are continuing our cooking for 2 shelters (80 people). We support students that stay in another shelter (150 people) with products and now they are cooking on their own.

We have sent aid to Bucha, Berdychiv, Kharkiv and a psychiatric hospital in Kyiv.

We are building a new shelter for more comfortable stay with showers and common kitchen. On this one we collaborate with two refugee architects from Kharkiv.

In Lviv we rented small apartments and helped with basic furnishing for 3 refugee families.

Thank you all for your support!"
