Dear friends, colleagues, students,

Thank you for your kind donations, for your moral support and for sharing our efforts. We have almost reached Â£2k with our fundraiser and will shortly be able to send the first batch of funding directly to our groups in Ukraine.

In the meantime, Yaryk, Luda and Tomasz have shared their daily soup recipes.
