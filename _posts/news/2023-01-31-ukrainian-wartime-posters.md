# DRINKS AND SOLIDARITY SALE: TUESDAY 21 FEBUARY, 6-9PM

An exhibition of posters created by artists and graphic designers who were forced to leave their homes due to military aggression and became temporarily displaced within the country. They have created wartime posters to fight the propaganda of the aggressor. The featured artists are part of a collective formed around an artist - run residency which used to be held in Biruchiy, on the Sea of Azov, now occupied territory. The group has re-organised and the exhibition is touring different international venues to raise awareness of the situation of artists and artist-run organisations in Ukraine.

“The artists show the reflections of the collective grief, despair, unbearable pain, sorrow and, at the same time, the willingness to fight and win. It is a cry for help, a declaration of our indomitable spirit and bravery, with elements of bitter irony and truth about specific events and war crimes,” says Olena Speranska, exhibition curator and director of the international residency programme Biruchiy.
