# ART SALE TO SUPPORT REFUGEES FLEEING WAR IN UKRAINE: 1 OCTOBER - 31 OCTOBER

Artists for Ukraine’s second public event is an art exhibition and art sale, taking place at St.
Andrew’s Church in Farnham from 1 - 31 October 2022. The exhibition features donations
from over 100 Ukrainian and international artists. This includes work by Svitlana Biedarieva,
Igor Gusev, Nikita Kadan, Zhanna Kadyrova, Alevtina Kakhidze, Lesja Khomenko, Pavlo
Makov, Olha Pryymak and Marcel Onisko, Ukrainian artists who are displaced or currently
sheltering from the war zone.

All funds raised from the art sale will go to support ‘Kuhknia’ (Kitchen) a private network of
volunteers based in Lviv, who are cooking meals in makeshift kitchens, sourcing medicine
and other vital supplies and arranging temporary accommodation in people’s homes or in
empty buildings, and other groups in needs, such as seniors and those who have not been
able to leave the country.

Thanks to donations, since February, Kukhnia have been able to serve more that 25,000
meals, care for 5 shelters and host more than 20 refugees together with 18 volunteers. Aid
shipments have also been sent to Bucha, Blystavytsya, Borodyanka, Vorzel, Ivankiv,
Kukhari, Kharkiv, Odesa and Uzhhorod.

However, we expect that with the winter approaching and with donations slowing down, it will
get harder and harder to maintain this level of support for those most vulnerable. We
desperately need your help so that Kukhnia can continue paying for essentials including rent
and food and support others in need.

Co-organisers, Susanne Clausen and Pavlo Kerestey have teamed up with Caroline Ingram
and Constance Uzwyshyn to raise funds to support the efforts in Ukraine.

In addition to the art sale, the opening event will include statements from those affected, and
words of solidarity from community leaders.

With kind of support of St. Andrew’s Church, Making Matters and the Ukrainian Institute
London.
