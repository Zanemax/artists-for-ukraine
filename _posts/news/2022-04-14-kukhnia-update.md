# Shelters Project

Olha has provided us with more images from the shelters project. She told us that Kukhnia are collaborating with Maria and Dimitrij to build sustainable shelters for refugees.

Maria is an architect, a draughtsman and she writes poetry. Dimitrij is a builder, pizza master and engineer. After escaping from Kharkiv they stayed in Lviv.

Here they are engaged in building a shelter for refugees called Pidsoma (@soma.masternia). Maria designed the space and Dimitrij is working on the construction. At the weekend they are cooking with Kukhnia.
