# Thank you!

Reading school students, teachers, families and friends raised over Â£4000 for Artists for Ukraine, by collectively running, cycling, rowing the total distance between Reading and Kyiv. On behalf of our team and Kukhnia we would like to thank you for all your efforts and for your solidarity.

Below is a short report on the impact of your donations, and what they have enabled Kukhnia to achieve in the last 10 days.

## Update 23 April 2022 from Olha Marusyn in Lviv

- We are cooking two meals for 100 people every day. We have now organised a permanent kitchen and people who stay in the shelter now also help with cooking.

- We have now almost finished the refugee shelter that we were building. We now only have to finish the shower. 13 people decided to stay there for a longer time.

- We have also sent food and medicine to Bucha and Chernihiv region. Jaryk Futymskiy is now in Kyiv buying supplies and bringing them to the liberated territories.

- We provide food supply packages to a group of older women and a family with six children, who are stranded in Lviv.
