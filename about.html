<h2>WHAT IS HAPPENING?</h2>
<p>On 24 February 2022 the Russian Federation launched a full-scall invasion of Ukraine, attacking urban centers across the country including Kyiv and Kharkiv on the ground and launching missile strikes towards every region of the country. This follows Russia's previous illegal anexation of Crimea and the support of seperatists in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in 2014. More than <a href="https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine">6.8 million refugees have fled the country</a>, and around a third of the country is displaced.</p>


<h2>THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION</h2>
<p>The invasion of Ukraine has caused the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/we-couldnt-stand-it-the-ukrainians-travelling-for-days-to-flee-russian-bombs-and-rockets">biggest refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war</a>.</p>

<p>Those fleeing from Russian advancement and arriving in the western Ukraine are in urgent need of essentials including food, medical supplies, temporary shelters, and protective equipement. While large organisations are providing support, it is small often self-organised groups that are making the crucial difference on the ground.</p>

<h2>WHO ARE WE?</h2>

<p>We are a group of artists based in Reading and at the University of Reading with connections to the country and those working every day to provide help to those who need it in cities such as Lviv and Uzhhorod.</p>

<p>You can donate to our campaign by purchasing artworks from our <a href="/shop">fundrasing exhibition</a>. We have brought together works by some of Ukraine's most well-known artists, as well as artists from the United Kingdom and the local community. Alternativeley, you can also donate directly to our cause. All funds will be used to support independent organisations working to support refugees in Ukraine.</p>

<h2>OUR WORK SO FAR</h2>

<p>We are proud to support Kukhnia, a group of artists that began the full-scale invasion feeding refugees ariving in Lviv, and are now building large temporary shelters. They have also sent supplies to the liberated city of Bucha and the Chernhiv region, where they are supporting rebuilding efforts.</p>

<p>The successful opening of our fundraising exhibition on 24 March, as well as the immense solidarity from local organisations such as Reading School has shown the massive scale of support that exists for Ukraine and those who still need urgent help.</p>
